# BASS-HI Project
** This is a BASS-HI project github repository. The BASS-HI project is the HI imaging survey of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)).**

We mainly use Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) for the atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) gas observation.
For more details, please see J.Kim et al. 2026 (in prep).
