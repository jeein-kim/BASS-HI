# BASS-HI: The Largest HI Imaging Survey of Hard X-ray Selected AGNs

---

## 🌌 Project Overview

The **BASS-HI survey** is an HI imaging program of ~100 hard X-ray–selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)). The project aims to understand how cold atomic gas is supplied to and redistributed within AGN host galaxies, and how large-scale environmental processes such as galactic interactions and gas accretion influence AGN activity. By using interferometric HI observations, **BASS-HI** directly maps extended gas morphologies and kinematics that are inaccessible via single-dish studies. The hard X-ray selection provides a relatively unbiased AGN census, including obscured systems, enabling a unique link between galaxy-scale gas properties, environment, and the central supermassive black hole.

## Hard X-ray Selection

The [BASS survey](https://www.bass-survey.com/) is based on hard X-ray (14–195 keV) selected AGNs from the Swift/BAT all-sky survey, which offers a more complete and less dust-biased view of the local AGN population. Compared to optical or soft X-ray selection, hard X-rays are less sensitive to torus obscuration, allowing access to a broader range of AGN obscuration states. This allows **BASS-HI** to study AGN fueling and host galaxy gas properties across a broad range of evolutionary stages, including gas-rich and merger-driven systems that are often missed in other surveys.

## 🎯 Key Science Goals

Triggering and sustaining AGN activity require a sufficient gas supply. It remains unclear whether internal secular evolution alone can provide this fuel, or whether external gas accretion is necessary. We therefore address the following questions:

- How frequently do host galaxies experience externally driven gas accretion?
- Do such large-scale processes have an impact on the central AGN activity?

While the extended nature of HI allows us to pose key questions about the large-scale environment and externally driven processes, spatially resolved HI imaging further enables us to directly address the following questions by probing the internal distribution and kinematics of the cold gas within AGN host galaxies.

- Where does the gas that fuels AGN activity originate?
	•	How does the onset of AGN activity affect the cold atomic hydrogen (HI) reservoirs of their host galaxies?
	•	Are AGNs responsible for quenching star formation, triggering it, or both, depending on evolutionary stage?

### 1. Resolving the AGN-HI Connection
Previous studies relying on single-dish observations or stacking remained inconclusive regarding whether AGN hosts are gas-deficient. BASS-HI provides **spatially resolved mapping** to move beyond integrated mass measurements and limited lines-of-sight. This essential imaging allows us to link the cold gas reservoir directly to the central black hole properties for a more complete physical picture.

### 2. HI Morphology and Kinematics
We investigate the dynamic state of the cold gas through resolved imaging. By measuring the **distribution and total angular momentum** of the HI disk, we can pinpoint the cause of star formation quenching or triggering. Our high-resolution data identifies kinematic footprints—such as increased velocity dispersion or inverted gradients—that connect AGN feedback to host galaxy evolution.

### 3. Probing the Environment and Accretion Histories
HI's large extent makes it a vulnerable and sensitive probe of the surroundings. Using high-sensitivity VLA D-array data, we trace **diffuse and extended HI features**—such as HI bridges, tidal tails, and streams—that are invisible at other wavelengths. These features serve as footprints of **recent or ongoing gas accretion**, helping us understand how external gas supply fuels the central engine.



### 4. A Statistically Robust Census of Resolved AGN Hosts
This is the first time a **hard X-ray selected sample** has been mapped in HI collectively. By building the **largest HI imaging survey of local AGN hosts (~100 targets)**, BASS-HI provides the statistical power needed to systematically investigate the connection between environmental interactions and quasar activity across a diverse range of host galaxy properties.

## Current Status & Data

The BASS-HI survey is the largest H I imaging survey of AGN host galaxies to date, based on the hard X-ray–selected BASS sample. The primary goal of the project is to connect host galaxy environments to AGN activity by addressing two key questions: (1) how frequently AGN host galaxies experience externally driven gas accretion, and (2) whether such large-scale processes impact central AGN activity. To maximize sensitivity to recent or ongoing accretion events, the survey focuses on H I-rich systems, which are most likely to exhibit signatures of external gas supply.


Targets were selected from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS DR2), which provides detailed constraints on black hole properties for hard X-ray–selected AGNs. The sample is limited to nearby systems (D < 120 Mpc) to ensure sufficient physical resolution with the VLA, and requires prior single-dish H I detections to guarantee the presence of neutral gas. VLA C-configuration observations provide spatially resolved H I maps of the host galaxies, while deeper D-configuration data enable the detection of diffuse gas in the surrounding environment. All archival and newly obtained data are uniformly reprocessed and analyzed to create a homogeneous H I imaging dataset.


## 📊 Sample Selection
Our sample is meticulously selected to ensure statistical robustness and to maximize the probability of detecting gas-environment interactions.


| Selection Step | # of Targets | Selection background & results |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **BASS Survey** | 858 | Targets drawn from the optical spectroscopic follow-up of hard X-ray (14–195 keV)-selected AGNs (the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey; BASS DR2), providing detailed constraints on black hole properties |
| **Nearby Sources** | 259 | A distance limit to ensure relatively good physical resolution with the VLA C-configuration ($D < 120$ Mpc, corresponding to 15" $\approx$ 8.7 kpc) |
| **BASS-HI** | ~100 | A previous single-dish HI detection to guarantee the presence of neutral hydrogen gas |

The full BASS-HI imaging sample consists of approximately 100 galaxies. This includes new Very Large Array (VLA) observations in C- and D-configurations of 40 northern targets, complemented by Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of 8 southern targets. In addition, extensive archival data from VLA, GMRT, WSRT, and ATCA have been incorporated, ensuring adequate sensitivity and spatial resolution across the sample.
