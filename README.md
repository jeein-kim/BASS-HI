# BASS-HI: The Largest HI Imaging Survey of Hard X-ray Selected AGNs

---

## 🌌 Project Overview

- The **BASS-HI survey** is an HI imaging program of ~100 host galaxies of hard X-ray–selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)). 
- The project aims to understand how cold atomic gas is supplied to and redistributed within AGN host galaxies, and how large-scale environmental processes such as galactic interactions and gas accretion influence AGN activity.
- By using interferometric HI observations, **BASS-HI** directly maps **the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of extended HI gas**, enabling us to identify signatures of gas accretion, environmental interactions, and internal redistribution that link large-scale processes to AGN activity.

## 🔷 Hard X-ray Selection

- The [BASS survey](https://www.bass-survey.com/) is based on hard X-ray (14–195 keV) selected AGNs from the Swift/BAT all-sky survey, which offers less dust-biased view, allowing access to a more complete view of the local AGN population. Probing diverse AGN types allows **BASS-HI** to study AGN fueling and host galaxy gas properties across **a broad range of evolutionary stages, including gas-rich and merger-driven systems** that are often missed in other surveys.
- Furthermore, the follow-up BASS observations provides a wealth of multiwavelength measurements of central black hole and host galaxy properties (e.g., Eddington ratio, black hole mass, star formation rate, etc.), making the BASS-selected AGN sample an ideal laboratory for probing the physical link between AGN activity and the cold gas in their host galaxies.

## 🎯 Key Science Goals

Triggering and sustaining AGN activity require a sufficient gas supply. It remains unclear whether internal secular evolution alone can provide this fuel, or whether external gas accretion is necessary. We therefore address the following questions:

- How frequently do host galaxies experience externally driven gas accretion?
- Do such large-scale processes have an impact on the central AGN activity?

While the extended nature of HI allows us to trace the large-scale environment and signatures of external interactions, **spatially resolved HI imaging** enables us to probe how AGN activity couples to the cold atomic gas in host galaxies. In particular, we address the following questions:

- How does the onset of AGN activity affect the cold atomic hydrogen (HI) reservoirs of their host galaxies?
- Can AGN feedback be observationally linked to the quenching or triggering of star formation, as traced by the distribution and kinematics of the HI gas from which molecular gas and stars can form?

### 1. Resolving the AGN-HI Connection
Previous studies relying on single-dish observations or stacking remained inconclusive regarding whether AGN hosts are gas-deficient. BASS-HI provides **spatially resolved mapping** to move beyond integrated mass measurements and limited lines-of-sight. This essential imaging allows us to link the cold gas reservoir directly to the central black hole properties for a more complete physical picture.

### 2. HI Morphology and Kinematics
We investigate the dynamic state of the cold gas through resolved imaging. By measuring the **distribution and total angular momentum** of the HI disk, we can pinpoint the cause of star formation quenching or triggering. Our high-resolution data identifies kinematic footprints—such as increased velocity dispersion or inverted gradients—that connect AGN feedback to host galaxy evolution.

### 3. Probing the Environment and Accretion Histories
HI's large extent makes it a vulnerable and sensitive probe of the surroundings. Using high-sensitivity VLA D-array data, we trace **diffuse and extended HI features**—such as HI bridges, tidal tails, and streams—that are invisible at other wavelengths. These features serve as footprints of **recent or ongoing gas accretion**, helping us understand how external gas supply fuels the central engine.



### 4. A Statistically Robust Census of Resolved AGN Hosts
This is the first time a **hard X-ray selected sample** has been mapped in HI collectively. By building the **largest HI imaging survey of local AGN hosts (~100 targets)**, BASS-HI provides the statistical power needed to systematically investigate the connection between environmental interactions and quasar activity across a diverse range of host galaxy properties.

## 📊 Sample Selection
Our sample is carefully selected to ensure statistical robustness and to maximize the probability of detecting gas-environment interactions.


| Selection Step | # of Targets | Selection background & results |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **BASS Survey** | 858 | Targets drawn from the optical spectroscopic follow-up of hard X-ray (14–195 keV)-selected AGNs (the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey; BASS DR2), providing detailed constraints on black hole properties |
| **Nearby Sources** | 259 | A distance limit to ensure relatively good physical resolution with the VLA C-configuration ($D < 120$ Mpc, corresponding to 15" $\approx$ 8.7 kpc) |
| **BASS-HI** | ~100 | A previous single-dish HI detection to guarantee the presence of neutral hydrogen gas |

The full BASS-HI imaging sample consists of approximately 100 galaxies. This includes new Very Large Array (VLA) observations in C- and D-configurations of 40 northern targets, complemented by Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of 8 southern targets. In addition, archival data from VLA, GMRT, WSRT, and ATCA have been incorporated, ensuring adequate sensitivity and spatial resolution across the sample.

In this section, we present the distributions of several AGN and host-galaxy properties for the BASS–HI sample and the parent BASS survey.
The BASS–HI survey applies only two selection criteria to the parent BASS sample: 1) a distance cut and 2) a requirement for sufficient gas content to enable robust HI analysis. As a result, the selected galaxies provide a relatively uniform representation of the local BASS galaxy population.

To show this, we present two figures. 
The top figure shows the distribution of bolometric luminosity for [the BASS DR2 (Koss et al. 2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..261....1K/abstract), **BASS–HI sample**, and the distance cut (D = 120 Mpc) as a vertical dashed line. 

In the bottom histograms, we compare key AGN and host-galaxy properties between our sample and the local BASS DR2 population with the same redshift range.
Shown, from left to right, are the distributions of black hole mass, Eddington ratio, host-galaxy stellar mass, and star formation rate.
