# BASS-HI: The Largest HI Imaging Survey of Hard X-ray Selected AGNs

**This is the official repository for the BASS-HI project, the HI imaging component of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)).**

---

## 🌌 Project Overview
BASS-HI is the largest dedicated HI imaging survey of AGN host galaxies to date. By leveraging the **Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS)**, we utilize a hard X-ray (14–195 keV) selection that provides a complete, dust-unbiased census of the local AGN population. 

Our mission is to resolve the spatial and kinematic distribution of the cold atomic hydrogen (HI) reservoir. This allows us to understand how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are fueled and how their feedback—mechanical or radiative—regulates star formation across the "Galactic Ecosystem."

### Current Status & Data
The survey is built upon a multi-scale observing strategy:
* **VLA Observations:** 40 northern targets observed in both **C-configuration** (resolving inner disk kinematics) and **D-configuration** (probing diffuse/extended gas).
* **ATCA Observations:** 8 southern targets to ensure all-sky coverage.
* **Archival Fusion:** High-quality data from **VLA, GMRT, WSRT, and ATCA** have been incorporated.
* **Final Sample:** Approximately **100 BASS-HI imaging galaxies**, creating a robust statistical foundation for AGN host studies.

## 🎯 Key Science Goals

### 1. Resolving the AGN-HI Connection
We aim to resolve the long-standing confusion over whether AGN host galaxies are gas-deficient. By providing the first large-scale resolved imaging of a hard X-ray selected sample, we can directly link central black hole properties (mass, accretion rate) to the spatially-resolved HI morphology.

### 2. Tracing Gas Accretion and Environmental Interactions
While the VLA C-array allows us to "peep" at the inner gas structure, our **D-array follow-up** is designed to detect the "smoking guns" of gas accretion:
* **Diffuse Reservoirs:** Detecting HI-bridges, streams, and tidal tails at low

## 🌌 Overview
The **BASS-HI Survey** is a comprehensive HI imaging program dedicated to mapping the cold neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in AGN host galaxies. By leveraging the **Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS)**, which selects AGNs using hard X-rays (14–195 keV), we bypass dust obscuration and star formation contamination. 

Our mission is to resolve the spatial and kinematic distribution of the cold gas reservoir to understand how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are fueled and how their feedback impacts the evolution of their host galaxies.

## 🎯 Key Science Goals

### 1. Resolving the AGN-HI Connection
We aim to settle the debate on whether AGN host galaxies are gas-deficient. By providing the first large-scale resolved imaging of a hard X-ray selected sample, we connect central black hole properties (mass, accretion rate) to the spatially-resolved HI morphology.

### 2. Tracing Gas Accretion Histories
Using the high sensitivity of the **VLA D-array**, we detect diffuse, extended HI features (bridges, streams, and tails) that are invisible in shallower surveys. These are the "smoking guns" of recent or ongoing gas accretion from the environment.

### 3. Pinpointing Quenching and Feedback
We investigate whether AGN activity quenches star formation by removing gas or triggers it through mechanical energy injection. By combining HI maps with multi-wavelength ancillary data (CO, IR, Optical), we build a complete picture of the "Galactic Ecosystem."

## 📡 Observation Strategy
We utilize a multi-scale approach by combining different VLA configurations to capture both the "Detailed" and the "Diffuse."



| Configuration | Focus | Key Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VLA C-array** | **Detailed Structure** | Resolving inner disk kinematics, gas stability, and localized outflows/jets. |
| **VLA D-array** | **Diffuse Reservoir** | Detecting extended structures and gas accretion from the IGM ($N_{HI} \approx 5 \times 10^{18} \text{ cm}^{-2}$). |
| **Integrated** | **Global Census** | Combining Northern (VLA/WSRT/GMRT) and Southern (ATCA) data for ~100 targets. |

## 📊 Sample Selection
Our sample is meticulously selected to ensure statistical robustness and to maximize the probability of detecting gas-environment interactions.



| Selection Step | # of Targets | Criteria & Purpose |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **BASS Survey** | 858 | Hard X-ray selected AGN (Swift/BAT) |
| **Nearby Sources** | 259 | $D < 120$ Mpc for optimal physical resolution (~8.7 kpc) |
| **BASS-HI** | 112 | Confirmed single-dish HI detection (ALFALFA/GBT) |
| **BASS-HI-rich** | **22** | **High-priority:** $5\sigma$ above xGASS mean; ideal for accretion studies. |

## 💡 Why Hard X-ray (Swift-BAT) Selection?
Unlike optical or soft X-ray surveys, the BASS selection provides:
* **Completeness:** Includes heavily obscured (Compton-thick) AGNs.
* **Unbiased Census:** Minimizes contamination from host galaxy star formation.
* **Direct Connection:** Probes the emission from the innermost regions near the central black hole.
